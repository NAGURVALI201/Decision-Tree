I took the titanic test file and the gender_submission and put them together in excel to make a csv. This is great for making charts to help you visualize. This also will help you know who died or survived. At least 70% right, but its up to you to make it 100% Thanks to the titanic beginners competitions for providing with the data. Please Upvote my dataset, it will mean a lot to me. Thank you!
